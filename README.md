The app uses Howler.js to map sounds to the keyboard randomly on load up.
The screen remains black until a key is pressed.

### Visual Mapping within Sound Taps:

The app uses Paper.js to randomly create a circle with its center placed at a point within the height and width of the screen.
There is also a looping function within Paper.js that shrinks the circles every frame.
If a circle's total area is under 3 px, the circle is removed.
